#3D Printed Prostheses  
Last year, my friends and I founded [Evolve 3D Labs](https://github.com/Evolve3DLabs) at Brenham High School. The purpose of the project was to ensure that our computer science club would continue to serve the community long after we graduated high school, by providing 3D-printed prostheses to children in need.  
  
##Completed Projects
###Hand for Kaedon
In 2014, I led our team in providing a 2-year-old boy in our community with a free, 3D-printed prosthetic hand. We received quite a bit of news coverage, and I've provided links below. Since this first project, we have continued to provide prostheses to children in need - at no cost whatsoever.

###Minecraft-themed hand for Brennen
Brennen's mother contacted us at Evolve 3D Labs after hearing about us on her local news, to ask us if we could make him a hand. We happily agreed, and I added some personalized Minecraft designs to [Enabling the Future](http://www.enablingthefuture.org)'s [Raptor](http://enablingthefuture.org/upper-limb-prosthetics/the-raptor-hand/) hand for him.

Here is a video his mother took of him receiving the hand on November 9th, 2015. He was ecstatic. [Link](https://drive.google.com/a/brenhamk-12.net/file/d/0B1tRGqoBo25gSkJoMldIUVFveC1vclBZLTQwajhoZGF0N3FR/view?usp=sharing)  

##Current Projects
###Thumb and Index Finger Replacement for Kensten  
Kensten was in a lawnmover accident a few years ago, and unfortunately he lost his left thumb and index finger. We are currently working on his prosthesis.

###Arduino-controlled arm for Ja'lea
We are currently working on a design for a girl in my community who is missing her entire right forearm. The arm and corresponding hand will be operated by muscle sensors and an Arduino. (https://github.com/ztaylor54) wrote the [code](https://github.com/ztaylor54/portfolio/blob/master/Folders/Prosthetic%20Hand/Prosthetic%20Arm/arm_code.ino); it reads data from the muscle sensor until a certain threshold is reached, then triggers the servo to either open or close the hand.
