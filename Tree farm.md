#Discount Trees of Brenham
I began working at Discount Trees of Brenham when I was 17 years of age. I had some basic knowledge of plants going into this job. My first summer of work was long, tough and a very HOT. I started off planting young trees, as well as basic tree maintenance throughout the tree farm.  
A year later I had enough knowledge to help customers find the perfect tree for their needs. I also knew many types of diseases and problems trees and plants can run into.  
Now after 3 years of working on a tree farm I have learned virtually everything there is to know about upkeep of many varieties of trees. I am also capable of identifying most trees in Texas and possible diseases that they can contain.  
By working on a tree farm I have discovered the pains of hard manual labor. I have also learned how to communicate with customers to find a perfect solution for their needs.
